# Artist references

A small web service that allows you to store your art references, tag them and work on them for a while. You upload your references to the site and structure them using tags. Next, you can start the service with one of the modes to work only with new works or fix errors, for example. All your results are saved for statistics so that you can later analyze your progress.
